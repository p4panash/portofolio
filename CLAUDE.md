## Development Requirements

1. **Always use `pnpm`** for all commands (dev, build, test, etc.)
2. **All code changes must pass existing Playwright tests** before committing
3. **Add new Playwright tests** for new features or components when appropriate
4. **Always format code with Prettier** (`pnpm format`) before committing
5. **Run `pnpm check`** to ensure TypeScript errors are resolved
