# Tech Stack

My primary technology stack for building robust, scalable web applications.

## Backend

### Ruby on Rails

A powerful MVC framework that enables rapid development of full-stack web applications. I leverage Rails for:

- RESTful API design
- ActiveRecord ORM for database interactions
- Background job processing
- Server-side rendering and API-only applications

### PostgreSQL

My database of choice for production applications, offering:

- ACID compliance and reliability
- Advanced indexing and query optimization
- JSON/JSONB support for flexible data structures
- Strong community and ecosystem support

### Redis

In-memory data structure store used for:

- Caching frequently accessed data
- Session storage
- Real-time features
- Message queue backing

### Sidekiq

A high-performance background job processor for Ruby that enables:

- Asynchronous task execution
- Scheduled jobs
- Email delivery
- Data processing pipelines

## Frontend

### React

The foundation of my frontend development, allowing me to:

- Build component-based UIs
- Manage complex application state
- Create reusable, maintainable code
- Deliver excellent user experiences

### Next.js

React framework that provides:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Optimized performance out of the box
- File-based routing

### Redux

State management library for predictable application state:

- Centralized state management
- Time-travel debugging
- Middleware support for async operations
- Excellent developer tools
