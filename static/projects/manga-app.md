## About
As a huge One Piece fan, I've been reading manga for some time. I always wanted to build a Manga app and felt React Native was the perfect tool for this job. This project was like hitting two birds with one stone; building an old idea app & learning something I've been curious about for a while. Very grateful for the [MangaDex](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/), without their API this idea would never see the light.

## Technology Stack
- React Native
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- [MangDex](https://api.mangadex.org/docs/) [API](https://api.mangadex.org/swagger.html#/)

## Screenshots
Thanks to Tailwind I was able to easily implement a design for both Light & Dark modes.
